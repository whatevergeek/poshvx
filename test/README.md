Testing
=======

The tests are organized by testing language. Thus Pester tests, which
are written in the PowerShell language, are in
[./powershell](./powershell) and xUnit tests, written in C#, are in
[./csharp](./csharp). The sanity tests for the Full .NET build of
PowerShell are in [./fullclr](./fullclr), and the third-party
[shebang][] test is in [./shebang](./shebang).
