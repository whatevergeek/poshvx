![logo][] PowerShell
====================

Welcome to the PowerShell GitHub Community!
PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models.
It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.

Downloading the Source Code
---------------------------

The PowerShell repository has a number of other repositories embedded as submodules.

To make things easy, you can just clone recursively:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell.git
```

If you already cloned but forgot to use `--recursive`, you can update submodules manually:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

See [working with the PowerShell repository](docs/git) for more information.
