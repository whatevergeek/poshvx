## DSC MOF Compilation Demo

[PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/PowerShell/dsc/overview) is a declarative configuration platform for Windows and Linux. DSC configurations can be authored in PowerShell and compiled into the resultant MOF document. 

This demo shows use of PowerShell to author a DSC configuration to set the configuration of an Apache web server. PowerShell scripting is used to assess distro and version-specific properties, such as the service controller and repo manager tools, for use in the configuration.
