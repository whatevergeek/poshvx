MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS 
MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY 
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you 
live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, 
which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft 
•         updates, 
•         supplements, 
•          Internet-based services, and 
•          support services 
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT 
USE THE SOFTWARE. 
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW. 
1.      INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.      Installation and Use.  You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, 
develop and test your programs. 
b.      Third Party Programs.  The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the 
third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are 
included for your information only. 
2.      DATA.  The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that 
to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to improve our products and services. You can learn

•          others have the right to modify it. 
4.      SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to 
use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite 
this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you 
must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. 
You may not 
•          work around any technical limitations in the software;

and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes. 
7.      EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You

These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, 
see  www.microsoft.com/exporting. 
8.      SUPPORT SERVICES.  Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it. 
9.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based 
services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support 
services. 
10.     APPLICABLE LAW. 
a.      United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the 
interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws 
principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state 
consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort. 
b.      Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of 
that country apply. 
11.    LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the 
laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the 
software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your 
country do not permit it to do so. 
12.    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF 
USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. 
YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR 
LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED 
UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER 
LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS. 
13.    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM 
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT 
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. 
This limitation applies to

third party programs; and 
•          claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, 
or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above 
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental, consequential or other damages.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. 
Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, 
accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne 
s’appliquera pas à votre égard. 
EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits 
prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de 
votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.DLL 
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.NATIVE.DLL 
MANAGEMENT.INFRASTRUCTURE.UNMANAGED.DLL
 
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They 
apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such 
services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply 
prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU 
COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU 
ACCEPT THESE TERMS.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS
a)	General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices.
b)	Included Microsoft Applications. The software may include other Microsoft applications. These 
license terms apply to those included applications, if any, unless other license terms are provided with 
the other Microsoft applications.
c)	Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that are licensed to you 
under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, 
for the third party applications may be accessible online at http://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an 
accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, 
limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.
2.	TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE
a)	Period. The software is time-sensitive and may stop running on a date that is defined in the software.

3.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be 
different from the commercially released version.
4.	FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, 
the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give 
feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to 
third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
5.	DATA COLLECTION. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and 
send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s 
products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some 
features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the 
software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with 
applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that 
accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about 
Microsoft’s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at 
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the 
Microsoft Privacy Statement.
6.	FONTS. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only (i) 
embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily 
download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable 
law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
a)	work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
b)	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
c)	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
d)	use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
e)	share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution 
for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
8.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations 
that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further 
information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.
9.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for 
the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.
10.	UPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You 
may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system 
to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. 
Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.
11.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, 
updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.
12.	APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States 
or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of 
business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims 
(including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws 
principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, 
you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, 
Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and 
venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
13.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may 
have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate 
and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from 
which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your 
state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the 
below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a)	Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this 
agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the 
automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to 
the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the 
software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific 
device or software.
c)	Germany and Austria.
i.	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in 
any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no 
contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
ii.	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based 
on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, 
Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in 
breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance 
of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the 
compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases 
of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
14.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING 
IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT 
PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, 
INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
15.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING 
DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM 
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER 
ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR 
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on 
third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, 
guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to 
the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. 
The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country 
may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois 
de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
